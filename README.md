# Crop_Recommendation_System
 Designed and implemented a machine learning model to recommend the most suitable crop for cultivation based on soil and  environmental features.
 
## Overview

This project addresses the critical challenge of crop yield prediction for farmers by leveraging machine learning techniques. By analyzing environmental factors such as temperature, rainfall, humidity, and soil nutrients, the system predicts the most suitable crop for a given set of conditions. The goal is to provide farmers with a decision-making tool to optimize yield and improve agricultural efficiency.

The system integrates multiple machine learning algorithms, compares their performance, and delivers predictions through a user-friendly web application.
